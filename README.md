# (1) elastic net based feature ranking

Elastic net is preferred in variable selection and widely used in intelligent diagnosis. However, its selected features are changed when the training set changes. 
To enhance the consistency of elastic net in feature selection, we propose an elastic net based feature ranking approach which considers both the frequency and weights 
of features.
